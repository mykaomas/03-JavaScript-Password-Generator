# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

Modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on their input into the application

## Motivation

My motivation for building this project was to put into practice the JavaScript skills, I had acquired during my third week of class. The project was challenging as it was easy to get overwhelmed with the criteria. 

When I started the project, I thought it would be easiest to start with randomizing the password. But I quickly realized I couldn't generate a password without creating prompts. Doing this project taught me to write out the necessary steps that need to be taken to meet the Acceptance Criteria. Writing out the list and then creating steps within that list helped me to better understand what was being asked of me. 

## General Information

The Acceptence Criteria has been met:

* The 'generate password' button displays a series of prompts for the password criteria and is displayed to the user:

    *length of password
    *special character
    *uppercase letter
    *lowercase letter
    *number

* The user has selects the appropriate length of 8-128 characters and the subsequent types of characters to include in the password

* If conditions are not met the user is prompted to reenter the required information to proceed

* A password is generated based on the user's answers to the preceding questions and is displayed on the page

* Console logs were added to track the input of the user on the backend to follow the process and catch errors  

### Below I've added the User Story and Acceptance Criteria for the assignment:

#### User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

#### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
